## ABOUT THE GAME

Guess The Color game is an engaging and interactive activity where a random color is shown on the screen. Players are presented with multiple color options, including the displayed color, and must choose the one that matches the displayed color.

## HOW TO PLAY

Playing Guess The Colour is not difficult. Simply, select the colour you feel matches the target color which is above the options. You can change your choice by simply clicking on another option, however once you've clicked the Confirm Choice button, the verdict will be delivered and a new set of colours will be displayed.

Each selection that matches the displayed colour gives a point and for every wrong selection, no new point is added. The game can be played and replayed for as many times as the player chooses.

It is also possible for multiple players to take turns picking the colours after each new display. Hence, it could be a fun game for a group of friends.

## FEATURES

- Interactive Interface
- Easily and readily navigatable
- Sound effects for different events, including scoring or making a wrong guess.
- Colorful blend of colours for every iteration of the game.
